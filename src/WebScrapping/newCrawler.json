SeaWorld has a ton to offer, with much smaller crowds and lesser wait times than any other theme park in Orlando. At SeaWorld, guests can take advantage of several opportunities to work one-on-one with animals by assisting a trainer in feeding them. They also offer animal encounters with Beluga Whales, Dolphins, Penguins, Walruses and Sea Lions! SeaWorld’s theme park has more than just roller coasters, it has water rides as well! There are several child friendly rides, such as Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin and newly opened Sesame Street Land. SeaWorld offers a ton of shows, staring some pretty unique animals, like Killer Whales. Don’t miss one of their most popular shows, Shamu’s Celebration: Light Up The Night or their nightly firework show where they bring the magic of the sea up into the sky!\n\n* ## Discovery Cove\n\nSeaworld also operates Discovery Cove which is a unique all-inclusive day resort. Guests can take their pick from swimming with dolphins, snorkeling expeditions with exotic fish and rays, as well as relaxing on their white sand beaches.\n\n### Contact Us\n\n\\[contact-form-7 id=\"265\" title=\"Blog Form\"\\]\n\n* Buy Disney World Tickets\n* Buy Universal Orlando Tickets\n* Universal Orlando Express Passes\n* Buy Disneyland Tickets\n\n### Shop with Confidence\n\n* Registered Travel Agency\n* Special Offers and Discounts\n* All Tickets Emailed or Shipped for Free\n\n### WE ARE SOCIAL\n\nOpen toolbar Accessibility Tools \n\nAccessibility Tools\n\n* Increase TextIncrease Text\n* Decrease TextDecrease Text\n* GrayscaleGrayscale\n* Readable FontReadable Font\n* Reset Reset"

    "content": "#### Magic Kingdom Two Day Plan\n\n#### Magic Kingdom Two Day Plan\n\n**A two day Magic Kingdom itinerary** is a great tool to use especially if you’re trying to do it all! You will be surprised at just how difficult it might be to see and do everything in the park even if you have **2 days at Magic Kingdom**. The main reason being the Magic Kingdom Park is by far the most-visited theme park in the world.\n\nIt’s home to so many classic Disney attractions such as the Haunted Mansion and Peter Pan’s Flight, as well as new favorites such as The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train. With more than double the attractions of any other theme park, it’s no surprise so many of our customers ask for a plan when visiting the **Magic Kingdom in two days.**\n\nThe Magic Kingdom Park has something for everyone to do from the young, to the young at heart. In this guide we’ll help show you the best way to do **Disney World in two days** so you get the most out of your **2 days at Magic Kingdom.**\n\nOur team members at The Park Prodigy have found that there are three important aspects when creating your **Magic Kingdom 2 Day Park plan**:\n\n1. Use Fastpass+ Efficiently\n2. Arrive Early\n3. Stay Late!\n\nFor our **Magic Kingdom two day plan** we recommend arriving 30 minutes ahead of park opening. This will allow you to take advantage of lower wait times on some of the most popular attractions. This will also allow you to make most of your Fastpass+ reservations for early afternoon.\n\nThis **Magic Kingdom itinerary** does include a midday break, and it is best suited for families with older children and young teens. We recommend at least two days at the Magic Kingdom to truly take advantage of everything the park has to offer. You might even want to add an extra half of day or full day so you don’t feel rushed. However we understand that this doesn’t always fit into the plan. Here is our **Magic Kingdom must do two day** park plan!\n\n## Fastpass+ For Your Magic Kingdom Strategy Guide\n\nFastpass+ Instructions – All guests can make up to 3 Fastpass+ selections for any given day with the purchase of a Walt Disney World theme park ticket. The first three Fast Pass + selections must be within the same theme park. If the guest has a Park Hopper plus ticket they can make additional Fastpass+ selection at a second park once all of the original selections have been used.\n\nOn Site Guests can make Fastpass+ selections using the My Disney Experience App up to 60 Days in advance of the day their trip starts. Furthermore if you are staying offsite but are connected to the My Disney Experience App of someone staying on site you can also make selections up to 60 Days in advance.\n\nOff Site Guests can make Fastpass+ Selections using the My Disney Experience App up to 30 days in advance of the day they plan to visit each park. This makes it extremely important to plan which parks you will visit on each day, as you will have to sign in several days in a row to make Fastpass+ reservations.\n\n## Magic Kingdom Two Day Plan\n\nIt’s important to note this free **Magic Kingdom two day touring plan** is just one of the many ways you can visit the park. You can take all of the **tips for Magic Kingdom in two days** and create your very own **Magic Kingdom guide.**\n\nIt’s important to always be mindful of height requirements at Disney World, which can impact how you approach your day. Magic Kingdom park is still one of the best theme parks for toddlers, so you should still be able to plan an amazing day.\n\n### Best Way to Spend 2 Days in Disney World\n\nSo what is the best way to spend 2 days at Magic Kingdom? If you realize that visiting **Magic Kingdom in two days** might be too much stress for your family, and you’re not going to see it all. Here is our tip for the best way to do Disney World in 2 days. Always relax and remember this is supposed to be fun! You might not get on absolutely everything but as long as you are with the ones you love have a great time!\n\nSo let’s get started!\n\n## Magic Kingdom Attraction Priority List\n\n| **Attraction Priority List**                                           | **Character Meet and Greet**                                          |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Visit within First Hour or Fast Pass+Priority #1                       | Visit within First Hour or Fast Pass+ Priority List                   |\n| 1) Seven Dwarfs Mine Train                                             | 1) Meet Cinderella and a Visiting Princess at Princess Fairytale Hall |\n| 2) Peter Pan’s Flight                                                  | 2) Meet Mickey Mouse at Town Square Theater                           |\n| 3) Space Mountain                                                      | 3) Meet Tinker Bell at Town Square Theater                            |\n| 4) Enchanted Tales with Belle                                          |                                                                       |\n| Visit within First Two Hours or Last Two Hours / Fast Pass+Priority #2 | **Parades and Fireworks**                                             |\n| 5) Splash Mountain                                                     | Fast Pass+ Priority List                                              |\n| 6) Big Thunder Mountain                                                | 1) Happily Ever After Fireworks Show                                  |\n| 7) Jungle Cruise                                                       | 2) Disney Festival Of Fantasy Parade                                  |\n| 8) Pirates of the Caribbean                                            |                                                                       |\n| 9) The Haunted Mansion                                                 |                                                                       |\n| 10) Dumbo the Flying Elephant                                          |                                                                       |\n| 11) The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh                             |                                                                       |\n| 12) Astro Orbiter                                                      |                                                                       |\n| 13) Buzz Lightyear Space Ranger Spinner                                |                                                                       |\n| 14) Tomorrowland Speedway                                              |                                                                       |\n| 15) Under the Sea Journey of the Little Mermaid                        |                                                                       |\n| 16) The Barnstormer Featuring the Great Goofini                        |                                                                       |\n| 17) It’s a Small World                                                 |                                                                       |\n\n## Magic Kingdom Two Day Plan\n\n**Fastpass+Selections**\n\nUsing the My Disney Experience App make advance Fastpass+ reservations for Peter Pan’s Flight 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM , Splash Mountain 12:00 PM – 1:00PM, Big Thunder Mountain 1:00 PM- 2:00 PM.\n\nThe below **Disney World Magic Kingdom Kingdom itinerary** is broken out by hour you enter the park as well as time.
